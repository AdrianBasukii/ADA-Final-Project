## About the game
The rules of this game are quite simple. The player is a hunter who is trying to run away from predators that chase the player. For 60 seconds, the hunter should avoid coming in contact with the predators, or it would be game over. The score is calculated by multiplying the number of predators that are currently on the screen by 5 and the score is added every 1000 ticks. Enemies could only be visible if they are within a certain range around the hunter (inside the circle), otherwise it will go invisible.
